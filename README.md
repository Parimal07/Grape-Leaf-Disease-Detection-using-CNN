# Grape Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
The Grape Leaf Disease Detection project aims to identify and classify diseases in grape leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to recognize various diseases such as Black Rot, ESCA, Healthy, and Leaf Blight. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Skills Learned
- Data preprocessing for image-based classification.
- Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Evaluating model performance using classification metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of grape leaves with four classes: Black Rot, ESCA, Healthy, and Leaf Blight. The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.

## CNN Model
The CNN model is designed to capture intricate patterns and features from grape leaf images. It includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification.
